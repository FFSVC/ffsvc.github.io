<p>Since the challenge will be held on the Codalab platform, please create a Codalab account if you do not have one. We kindly request you to associate your account to an institutional e-mail. The organizing committee reserves the right to revoke your participant to the challenge otherwise, please read the <a href="../assets/pdf/ffsvc2022_plan.pdf">evaluation plan</a> carefully. Make sure to set the name of your team in the user's profile, or it will not be visible on the leaderboard.</p> The following is the Codalab links corresponding to each task:

<ul>
    <li> <a href="codalab task 1">Task 1. Fully supervised far-field speaker verification</a>. </li>
    <li> <a href="codalab task 2">Task 2. Semi-supervised far-field speaker verification</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>Participants can register in one or two tasks. If your team participates in multiple tasks, we kindly request you to use the same user account to participate in all tasks.</p>

<p>Please note that any deliberate attempts to bypass the submission limit (for instance, by creating multiple accounts and using them to submit) will lead to automatic disqualification.</p>
